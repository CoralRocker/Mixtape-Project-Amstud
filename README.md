# Side A Explanation
[Spotify Playlist For Side A](https://open.spotify.com/user/gotzegot/playlist/3oRICn2S8WGJYFny1HsOcc?si=X4KMfBtRRyOrn5HA-WuMAw "Side A")
### As A Whole
  This side of the mixtape is for when I need to relax. The songs on this side are energetic, yet still lack vocals and so are relaxing to listen to. When I get migraines, as I often do, one of the things that helps me is to listen to good music. However, songs that I would normally listen to, like those on side B, are often too vocal and hurt to listen to. So, I have a few long playlists (totalling approximately 14 hours) of classical music and opera that I listen to when I'm not in the mood for any other music. 
### Song-By-Song
| Song | Reasoning|
|:-:|:-|
|Concerto No. 2 B minor 7: III Rondo| This piece is one of the most famously difficult concertos ever written for violin. I find it to be a very interesting piece to listen to, and, as a violin player, I appreciate the musicianship, skill, and time that the piece demands of its players. I put first because it is a lively piece, and if I am playing the playlist in order to feel better, this piece will surely help.|
|Concerto E minor Op. 64: I Allegro| One Mendelssohn's better known pieces, this concerto for violin is a good follow-up to the previous piece because of the similar violin style of both composers. Additionally, this piece, the one after it, the one after that, and the previous one all share a similar tempo, allegro, which helps the transitions between songs feel effortless and smooth.|
|Concerto D minor Op. 47: III Allegro, ma non tanto|One of the lesser known pieces on this mixtape, this song exemplifies Romantic music. The piece makes me envision powerful mountain capped with snow and covered with pine trees, and personally, when I've got a migraine, seeing that image instead of a dark room is a pleasant change of pace.|
|Symphony No. 3 A minor Op. 56 MWV N 18: IV Allegro Maestoso Assai|This song once again follows in the footsteps of the previous songs on the playlist in that is a Romantic song. It is here on the mixtape for almost the same reason as the previous song, and achieves that purpose well. The image it displays is different from that of the previous song in that this song, to me, paints a scene with much more turmoil, perhaps one by the seaside, for instance. In any case, this song is perfectly suited for giving me energy when I don't feel well.
|Hungarian Dance No. 5 G minor|In comparison to the grandeur of the previous two pieces in the mixtape, this piece might feel a bit lacking in power, but what it lacks in power and awe-factor, this piece makes up for in catchiness and how lively it is. Its transition from Mendelssohn's 3rd symphony is admittedly not the smoothest, as the two pieces share very different styles, but it is important in its placement as it is the song that signals the nearing of the end of the mixtape, and putting another Romantic-era song in its place would not be fitting.
|St. Paul's Suite: IV Allegro|This is one of the pieces that my orchestra is playing for our next concert, so there is definetely a personal connection between the piece and I. However, it follows Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 5 well, as it follows closely in its composition. However, this piece is a finale to a suite and as such is good piece to end the mixtape with.

### As A Whole
  This side of the mixtape is for when someone wants to do something fun, work outside, or simply listen to some fun and energetic songs. Most of the songs a rock songs from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, but there are a few country songs mixed in, so long as they're upbeat. The playlist has very little deep significance to me, and serves a purely entertainment-based role in my day-to-day life. 
### Song-By-Song
|Song|Reasoning|
|:-:|:-|
|Baba O'Riley|Baba O'Riley is a good song to start the mixtape with because it is not particularly fast and energetic. It starts the playlist off at a moderate tempo, which leaves room for later songs to speed up. In spite of its relatively slow speed, it still is energetic, and it has a solid driving beat from its guitar and background synth.|
|Travelin' Band|This song is significantly more energetic than Baba O'Riley and is a fun song to do some outdoors work to.
|Life In The Fast Lane - 2013 Remaster|This famous song by the Eagles is calmer than the previous song, yet belongs here to serve as a transition between the high intensity of CCR's Travelin' Band and the calmer, more melodious Burnin' For You.|
|Spirit In The Sky|This one-hit-wonder from ironically jewish singer Norman Greenbaum completes the downhill slope in energy in the playlist. The song serves a low point in volume for the playlist. The song somewhat represents the break that most people take while they work on a project, between the first hard period of work, and the last final push to the end.|
|Superstition|After the aforementioned slow point in the mixtape, this song serves as a crescendo in energy, one which ends with Bob Seger's hit Old Time Rock & Roll.|
|All Along The Watchtower|The sweet guitar played by Hendrix in this song is great for working to and, personally, energizes me greatly.|
