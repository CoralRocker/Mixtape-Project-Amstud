# Side A Explanation
[Spotify Playlist For Side A](https://open.spotify.com/user/gotzegot/playlist/3oRICn2S8WGJYFny1HsOcc?si=X4KMfBtRRyOrn5HA-WuMAw "Side A")
### As A Whole
  This side of the mixtape is for when I need to relax. The songs on this side are energetic, yet still lack vocals and so are relaxing to listen to. When I get migraines, as I often do, one of the things that helps me is to listen to good music. However, songs that I would normally listen to, like those on side B, are often too vocal and hurt to listen to. So, I have a few long playlists (totalling approximately 14 hours) of classical music and opera that I listen to when I'm not in the mood for any other music. 
### Song-By-Song
| Song | Reasoning|
|:-:|:-|
|Concerto No. 2 B minor 7: III Rondo| This piece is one of the most famously difficult concertos ever written for violin. I find it to be a very interesting piece to listen to, and, as a violin player, I appreciate the musicianship, skill, and time that the piece demands of its players. I put first because it is a lively piece, and if I am playing the playlist in order to feel better, this piece will surely help.|
|Concerto E minor Op. 64: I Allegro| One Mendelssohn's better known pieces, this concerto for violin is a good follow-up to the previous piece because of the similar violin style of both composers. Additionally, this piece, the one after it, the one after that, and the previous one all share a similar tempo, allegro, which helps the transitions between songs feel effortless and smooth.|
|Concerto D minor Op. 47: III Allegro, ma non tanto|One of the lesser known pieces on this mixtape, this song exemplifies Romantic music. The piece makes me envision powerful mountain capped with snow and covered with pine trees, and personally, when I've got a migraine, seeing that image instead of a dark room is a pleasant change of pace.|
|Symphony No. 3 A minor Op. 56 MWV N 18: IV Allegro Maestoso Assai|
|Hungarian Dance No. 5 G minor|In comparison to the grandeur of the previous two pieces in the mixtape, this piece might feel a bit lacking in power, but what it lacks in power and awe-factor, this piece makes up for in catchiness and how lively it is. Its transition from Mendelssohn's 3rd symphony is admittedly not the smoothest, as the two pieces share very different styles, but it is important in its placement as it is the song that signals the nearing of the end of the mixtape, and putting another Romantic-era song in its place would not be fitting.
|St. Paul's Suite: IV Allegro|This is one of the pieces that my orchestra is playing for our next concert, so there is definetely a personal connection between the piece and I. However, it follows Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 5 well, as it follows closely in its composition. However, this piece is a finale to a suite and as such is good piece to end the mixtape with.
